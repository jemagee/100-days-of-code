# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started basics of creating a user profile on Code Connection, including adding the first user specific trait, country.  

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how fast the programming muscles can atrophy - it's been a while since I've written any rails code (a coupld months) let alone any serious code at all (a few weeks) due to a variety of reasons, but I am going to have to get back into this project to get it to work.  It's obviously a much bigger project than I could have possibly thought but if I don't do work on it no one else is going to.  Hopefully I'll get faster and more focused as time goes on.  I also used a new gem, country_select, and found that stack overflow is still the primary source of archived answers to problems, even though I prefer reddit for current discussions.

**Links Used for Today's Work**

* [Country Select Gem](https://github.com/stefanpenner/country_select)
* [Countries Gem](https://github.com/jemagee/code_connection/projects)
* [Selecting A Value from a list, using Capybara](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25282012/selecting-value-in-dropdown-with-capybara)

***Things I want to work on Next***

* I'd like to make the users/id path so it just shows profile, thought I figured out how from the rails guide, but did not.
* The profile information needs to expand, time zones are helpful, some countries have many, it'd be nice to link the time zone to the country so if it's only one it's automatically populated but if country has many the select list only has those options - yay Javascript or VueJS?
* There are over 500 countries in the country_select, being able to start typing the name of your country to narrow down the list would be nice, selectize is a nice JS tool for that, but implementing js testing in RSpec can be tricky
* Layouts Layouts Layouts, I didn't really do any styling of layouts, just put the information on the page required for tests to pass
